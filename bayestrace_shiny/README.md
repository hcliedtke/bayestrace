# BayesTrace

This is a diagnostic/visualization tool for [BayesTraits](http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.1/BayesTraitsV4.0.1.html) output.

The aim is to produce a standardized report that can be useful for interpreting results, but also to accompany research papers as supplementary materials.

### Features under developlemnt

- [ ] Improve root state pie chart (make interactive)
- [ ] Improve phylogeny representation (ggtree + plotly, or network3d dendrogram)
- [ ] Add pGLS features
